<!-- The computer is not allowing me to write a tag in the text without it mistaking it for me trying to use that tag. For that reason when I write tags in my text, I put spaces inbetween each character so that it can appear on the web page as text. Just wondering if there is a way around this. -->

<h1><b>How the Internet Works</b></h1>
<p>The function of the internet is to allow computers to communicate information to one another through it. That is made possible through a <em>server</em>, the <em>HTTP</em> protocol, the <em>internet</em> itself, and a <em>browser</em>. Servers are computers that's job is to host files. While on the other hand, the typical user uses their computer to view files that servers host. The HTTP protocol takes requests from the internet and returns the appropriate files based on the request from the browser. The internet communicates with browers, by taking requests from the browser and then displaying the appropriate content on them. An example of how this process works is by, lets say, you open your web browser and you type in google.com then hit enter. Your browser sends its request to go onto google.com via the internet. The internet communicates this request with the HTTP protocol, which then retrives the appropriate files from the server. The server returns the appropriate files via the HTTP protocol, which then communicates this information through the internet, which then finally displays the content on your web browser.

  As the photo above shows, HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, although Hypertext is one word rather than two. HTML is a tool that allows programmers to make web pages. HTML is a very popular programming language and for that reason the majority of the content on the web is written in HTML. HTML is made up of text, what we see, and markup what the text looks like.</p>

<h1><b>Tags, Elements, and Attributes</b></h1>
<p> Tags are functions enlcosed in angled brakcets. The text imbeded between tags is called the tag's content. To make a word(s) appear bold, a bold tag < b > is needed before the word or words you wish to make bold. To communicate to your computer that you no longer want the bold function to execute on your text, you can use a closing tag, which looks like this for the bold function < / b >. A closing tag is not necessary in every case. For example in the case that you want all your text in a web page to be bold a closing tag would be of no use. Once the computer reads the opening tag it will apply it to all the text that comes after it. Another instance where a closing tag is not necessary, is for <em>void tags</em>. Void tags do not have content and for that reason they have no closing tags. Like the line break tag < br > which causes the text to appear on the next line rather than continuing to appear on the same line if space permits. Another feature that some tags have are <em>attributes</em>. Attributes are inserted in the opening tag for certian fucnitons. An equal symbol is used to assign a <em>value</em> to the attribute. A value is put inbetween quotation marks. Tags can have multiple attributes along with their respective values. A good example of a tag with an attribute is the anchor tag, < a href = "url" > content < / a >, which when used provides access to a link for the user. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411">Click here for more information on <em>attributes</em></a>. All together an opening tag, attributes (if needed), content, and closing tag are called an element. An illustration of the pieces of an element is shown below.

I once heard an insructor tell my class that you can think of a computer as a really fast but dumb friend, which makes sense because the slightest error(s) in code can cause the computer to do something completely different than what was intended. Computers cannot self fix these errors, and for that reason programmers have to give very specific instructions to the computer in order for it to perform a desired task. Nonetheless, if you have the ability to talk to a computer, you become the one in charge rather than vice versa.</p>
<h1><b>Block VS Inline Elements</b></h1>
<p>HTML tags can either be <em>block</em> or <em>inline</em>. Block tags can be thought of as forming an invisible box around the content within it. On the other hand, inline tags stay within the line it's on. A couple block tags are the paragraph and div tags. Some of the inline tags we've seen are the bold, emphasis, anchor, image, span, and break tags. The break tag can be mistaken for being a block tag, but is actually an inline tag. The image below provides a distinction between both catagories of tags.
